# 🎸 Aestis Guitar Pro File Repository

Welcome to our band's Guitar Pro file repo!  
This is where we keep all our `.gp`, `.gp5`, or `.gpx` files organized, versioned, and backed up — so we can collaborate without overwriting each other's work.

---

## 💡 What is This?

- **Git** is a way to keep track of changes to files over time (like version history).
- **GitHub** is a website that hosts our Git project so everyone can contribute.
- **Branches** are like copies of the project where you can make changes safely. When you’re done, you can merge them back into the main version.

> Think of a branch as your own sandbox. You can try things without messing up anyone else’s work.

### Step 4 (Optional): Make a Pull Request

If your part is ready to be added to the main version:

1. Go to the **Pull Requests** tab at the top.
2. Click `New pull request`.
3. Compare your branch to `main`.
4. Click **Create pull request**, write a message, and submit.

That’s it! Someone will review and merge it when it’s ready.
